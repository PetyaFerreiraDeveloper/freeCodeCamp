      <h1>Examples of CSS Combinators</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Descendant Combinator</h2>
        <p>
          Here I will target all paragraphs within a div parent. Even ones that
          are deeply nested inside other elements. Note that a
          <code>space</code> is used between the parent and child selector.:
        </p>
        <div class="descendant-combinator">
          <p>This is a paragraph inside a parent div.</p>
          <div>
            <p>This is a paragraph inside a child div.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Child Combinator</h2>
        <p>
          The child combinator (<code>></code>) in CSS is used to select
          elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.
        </p>
        <div class="child-combinator">
          <p>This is a direct child paragraph.</p>
          <div>
            <p>This is a nested paragraph and should not be styled.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            This is third paragraph but it is direct child of parent element
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Next sibling Combinator</h2>
        <p>
          The next sibling combinator (<code>+</code>) in CSS is used to select
          an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element.
        </p>
        <div class="next-sibling-combinator">
          <p class="next-sibling-combinator__first-child">
            This is the first paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>This is the second paragraph, which is a next sibling.</p>
          <p>This is another paragraph, not a next sibling.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Subsequent Sibling Combinator</h2>
        <p>
          The subsequent-sibling combinator (<code>~</code>) in CSS selects all
          siblings of a specified element that come after it. They are not
          required to be immediately adjacent, but they must share the same
          parent.
        </p>
        <div class="subsequent-sibling-combinator">
          <p class="subsequent-sibling-combinator__first-child">
            This is the first paragraph.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>This is a nested paragraph inside a div.</p>
          </div>
          <p>third paragraph</p>
          <p>fourth paragraph</p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
